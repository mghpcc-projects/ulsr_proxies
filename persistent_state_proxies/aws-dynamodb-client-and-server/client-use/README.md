Once server is installed the client can be accessed through HTTPS ``GET`` and ``POST`` requests. Each instance of the server will have a different URL. The URL provides three endpoints, each with a different URL

   1. ``hello-world`` e.g. https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/hello-world
   
   2. ``put`` e.g. https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/ulsr-res-id
   
   3. ``get`` e.g. https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/ulsr-res-id ``/RESERVATION_ID``
   
   Accessing any of the endpoints requires and API key that is passed in the x-api-key header field of the HTTP request.
   
   ### Endpoints
   
   * The ``hello-world`` endpoint (https://github.com/mghpcc-projects/ulsr_proxies/blob/c1c804632a59950c13faad1f227a4fc028fbc151/persistent_state_proxies/aws-dynamodb-client-and-server/serverless-aws-code/nodejs-form/handler.js#L6)provides a simple test of the Lambda function. It can be invoked by e.g.
   
      ```
      curl -H "X-Api-Key: KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK" https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/hello-world
      ```
   
      where ```KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK``` is the API key secret. The ``hello-world`` endpoint returns information on the query received by the Lambda function. It does not interact with DynamoDB.
