Once server is installed the client can be accessed through HTTPS ``GET`` and ``POST`` requests. Each instance of the server will have a different URL. The URL provides three functions, each with a different URL

   1. ``hello-world`` e.g. https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/hello-world
   
   2. ``put`` e.g. https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/ulsr-res-id
   
   3. ``get`` e.g. https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/ulsr-res-id ``/RESERVATION_ID``
   
   Accessing any of the interfaces requires and API key that is passed in the x-api-key header field of the HTTP request.
   
   The ``hello-world`` interface provides a simple test of the Lambda function. It can be invoked by e.g.
   
   ```
   curl -H "X-Api-Key: KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK" https://0e5f0zcx22.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e1TimTesting20180304/hello-world
   ```
